# Jump Tracker

The Jump Tracker is meant to allow anyone to track their vertical jump progress over time.

This will allow you to set goals, record your vertical jumps in inches or centimeters, 
and see how long it will take you to achieve your goals.

## Current setup

This project uses pipenv to manage dependencies. To install all the requirements, just clone this repository 
and run this (which works through the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files)

```
pipenv install
```
